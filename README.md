# strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced

## Configuration

This extends the original configurability of the provider by adding both a
`baseUrl`, which may be your CDN URL, which replaces the endpoint returned from
AWS with a custom URL, and `prefix`, which does exactly that: prefixes the
object's path such that we do not strictly upload into the buckets root
directory. This can be used to keep the bucket organized, or using a singular bucket
for multiple services. Other than that you can put e.g. CloudFront Caching in front of the
bucket and only expose the CloudFront URL to e.g. save traffic costs that come from
direct bucket access.

Everything else follows the regular strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3 schema.

Your configuration is passed down to the provider. You can see the complete list of options
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-s3/index.html)

See the [using a
provider](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins/upload.html#using-a-provider)
documentation for information on installing and using a provider. And see the
[environment
variables](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations.html#environment-variables)
for setting and using environment variables in your configs.

To upload with ACLs, **make sure that the S3 user has abilities
"s3:PutObjectACL" in addition to the regular "s3:PutObject" ability**. Otherwise
S3 will reject the upload with "Access Denied".

If you cannot provide access key and secret, but instead use other (AWS) tools
to authenticate to your bucket, omit `providerOptions.accessKeyId` and
`providerOptions.secretAccessKey`. For more, see
<https://github.com/zoomoid/strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced/pull/14>.

### Example

`./config/plugins.js`

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  // ...
  upload: {
    provider: "aws-s3-advanced",
    providerOptions: {
      accessKeyId: env("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
      secretAccessKey: env("AWS_ACCESS_SECRET"),
      region: env("AWS_REGION"),
      params: {
        bucket: env("AWS_BUCKET"), // or "Bucket", @aws-sdk requires capitalized properties, but the convention for this file is lowercased, but the plugin understands both
        acl: env("AWS_BUCKET_ACL"), // or "ACL", see above
      },
      baseUrl: env("CDN_BASE_URL"), // e.g. "https://cdn.example.com", this is stored in strapi's database to point to the file
      prefix: env("BUCKET_PREFIX"), // e.g. "strapi-assets". If BUCKET_PREFIX contains leading or trailing slashes, they are removed internally to construct the URL safely
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

If using strapi >= 4.0.0, please use the below config:

`./config/plugins.js`

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  // ...
  upload: {
    config: {
      provider: "strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced",
      providerOptions: {
        accessKeyId: env("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
        secretAccessKey: env("AWS_ACCESS_SECRET"),
        region: env("AWS_REGION"),
        params: {
          bucket: env("AWS_BUCKET"), // or "Bucket", @aws-sdk requires capitalized properties, but the convention for this file is lowercased, but the plugin understands both
          acl: env("AWS_BUCKET_ACL"), // or "ACL", see above
        },
        baseUrl: env("CDN_BASE_URL"), // e.g. "https://cdn.example.com", this is stored in strapi's database to point to the file
        prefix: env("BUCKET_PREFIX"), // e.g. "strapi-assets". If BUCKET_PREFIX contains leading or trailing slashes, they are removed internally to construct the URL safely
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

If you need to extend the configuration of the S3 client with additional
properties, put them into `providerOptions.params`. The `params` object is
spread into the S3 configuration at initialization, so it will accept any
additional configuration this way.

> Note: If you are migrating from a pre-4.0.0 version (i.e. v3.6.8 or earlier),
> the `files` relation will include `aws-s3-advanced` as the provider.
> Previously, the prefix "strapi-upload-provider" was assumed to always be
> present for upload provider plugins. _This is no longer the case in >= 4.0.0_,
> hence when uploading with the newer version of this provider, strapi will
> insert new files with the full provider package name, i.e.,
> `strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced`. See [Migration](#migration) for
> details on the required manual work.

#### Image Previews

To allow the thumbnails to properly populate, add the below config to

`./config/middlewares.js`

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => [
  // ...
  {
    name: "strapi::security",
    config: {
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        useDefaults: true,
        directives: {
          "connect-src": ["'self'", "https:"],
          "img-src": ["'self'", "data:", "blob:", `${env("CDN_BASE_URL")}`],
          "media-src": ["'self'", "data:", "blob:", `${env("CDN_BASE_URL")}`],
          upgradeInsecureRequests: null,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
];
```

## Migration

### v5.0.0

You don't need to do anything on your end except updating the dependencies.

v5.0.0 rewrites the entire provider in Typescript and introduces Unit Tests,
among deprecating NodeJS versions lower than v14. Specifically the last aspect
requires a new major version. Other than that, nothing changed in terms of
configuration surface.

### v4.1.x

To allow for an empty `baseUrl` (#9), we made some adjustments to the way the
configuration is parsed: in your `plugins.js`, `env("CDN_BASE_URL")` uses
strapi's helper function for parsing ENV variables. If any second argument is
omitted, `undefined` is returned. Thus, if your ENV does not contain any value
for `CDN_BASE_URL`, you are good to go. Undefined `baseUrl` causes the plugin to
prepend the cannonic default endpoint of your storage provider, e.g.,
`https://mystoragebucket.s3.amazonaws.com`.

**If instead you defined `CDN_BASE_URL` to be `""`, the `env` helper returns
that empty string.** Previously, this was treated as the same case as using
`undefined`. In some scenarios however you might not want this, e.g., local
development. **Thus, we now check explicitly for undefinedness instead of the
prior truthiness.**. If you defined `CDN_BASE_URL` to be an empty string and
relied upon the prepending of the cannonical default endpoint, change your ENV
variable either explicitly to the endpoint's URL **or** make it undefined.

### v3.x to v4.0.x

Strapi now uses the full package name as provider name, as seen in the
configuration of the provider in the Example section above. This means that the
relation will include different provider names when using the newer version of
this provider with strapi >= 4.0.0 on data from pre-4.0.0. In particular, you
will find that the pre-4.0.0 `files` will have the provider `aws-s3-advanved`,
while the newer ones will have `strapi-provider-aws-s3-advanved`. **If you're
not going to change the existing files in your CDN, you will not need to take
any actions**. The provider attribute is only used for mapping the handler for
creating or deleting files to the handlers defined in _this_ provider. Files
will remain readable with the old provider and new files will be added with the
new provider name. **Only if you want to delete old files from the new provider,
you will be required to adapt the `files` table**.

In strapi >= 4.0.0, only SQL databases are officially supported, so we will only
provide queries for the supported backends:

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
UPDATE files SET provider = 'strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced' WHERE provider = 'aws-s3-advanced';
```

#### MySQL

```sql
UPDATE `files` SET `provider` = `strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced` WHERE `provider` = `aws-s3-advanced`;
```

#### SQLite

```sql
UPDATE files SET provider = 'strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced' WHERE provider = 'aws-s3-advanced';
```
